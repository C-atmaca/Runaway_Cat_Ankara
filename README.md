Game made in 48 hours in DevJam game developing marathon.

This is a fast paced 2D platformer game made with unity in 48 hours. 
The code is messy and I had to use a lot of suboptimal shortcuts that I am not very proud of, but the time was short, and overall I am pretty happy with the result.

I didn't edit the project or fix any bugs after the competition has ended I might in the future.

# Runaway_Cat_Ankara
Game made in 48 hours in DevJam game developing marathon.

This is a fast paced 2D platformer game made with unity in 48 hours. I did use free sprites and background images since I have no experience in drawing.
The code is messy and I had to use a lot of suboptimal shortcuts that I am not very proud of, but the time was short, and overall I am pretty happy with the result.

I didn't edit the project or fix any bugs after the competition has ended. I might do that in the future.
